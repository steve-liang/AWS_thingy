## Mac is my preferred environment

Accessing AWS EC2 from mac is more convenient than from Windows, because terminal is __the__ tool for SSH. All I need is the AWS key pair and the IP address of my EC2 instance. 

However, one issue I ran into is that I need to convert my .PPK (PuTTy key format) file to .PEM (Mac). So I need to install *putty* on Mac OS to do key conversion. But before I can install putty, I also need to install *port*, which is an apt-get equivalent for mac. 

## Preparation

1. Download *port* from https://www.macports.org/install.php
2. Install port
3. In terminal, navigate to key folder and then run ```puttygen your_key.ppk -O private-openssh -o your_key.pem``` to get the conversion processed
4. Make key read by owner ```chmod 400 your_key.pem```
5. Log on to my EC2 instance ```ssh -i your_key.pem ubuntu@ip_address```
